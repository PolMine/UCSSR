abstract = {This book examines approaches to carrying out discourse analysis (DA) using techniques that are grounded in corpus linguistics. Assuming no prior knowledge of corpora, the book examines and evaluates a variety of corpus-based methodologies including:. * collocations,. * keyness. * concordances. * dispersion plots. * building and annotating corpora. Illustrated with a number of real-life examples of corpus-based DA from a range of sources and covering a variety of subjects, this is an informative introduction to using corpus linguistics as a methodology in discourse analysis..},
