abstract = {Sentiment analysis is the computational study of people's opinions, sentiments, emotions, and attitudes. This fascinating problem is increasingly important in business and society. It offers numerous research challenges but promises insight useful to anyone interested in opinion analysis and social media analysis. This book gives a comprehensive introduction to the topic from a primarily natural-language-processing point of view to help readers understand the underlying structure of the problem and the language constructs that are commonly used to express opinions and sentiments. It covers all core areas of sentiment analysis, includes many emerging themes, such as debate analysis, intention mining, and fake-opinion detection, and presents computational methods to analyze and summarize opinions. It will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in natural language processing, computer science, management sciences, and the social sciences.},
