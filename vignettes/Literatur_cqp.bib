abstract = {This book examines approaches to carrying out discourse analysis (DA) using techniques that are grounded in corpus linguistics. Assuming no prior knowledge of corpora, the book examines and evaluates a variety of corpus-based methodologies including:. * collocations,. * keyness. * concordances. * dispersion plots. * building and annotating corpora. Illustrated with a number of real-life examples of corpus-based DA from a range of sources and covering a variety of subjects, this is an informative introduction to using corpus linguistics as a methodology in discourse analysis..},

abstract = {Automated text analysis methods have made possible the classification of large corpora of text by measures such as topic and tone. Here, we provide a guide to help researchers navigate the consequential decisions they need to make before any measure can be produced from the text. We consider, both theoretically and empirically, the effects of such choices using as a running example efforts to measure the tone of New York Times coverage of the economy. We show that two reasonable approaches to corpus selection yield radically different corpora and we advocate for the use of keyword searches rather than predefined subject categories provided by news archives. We demonstrate the benefits of coding using article segments instead of sentences as units of analysis. We show that, given a fixed number of codings, it is better to increase the number of unique documents coded rather than the number of coders for each document. Finally, we find that supervised machine learning algorithms outperform dictionaries on a number of criteria. Overall, we intend this guide to serve as a reminder to analysts that thoughtfulness and human validation are key to text-as-data methods, particularly in an age when it is all too easy to computationally classify texts without attending to the methodological choices therein.},

    abstract = { This article presents a dictionary-based measurement of populist communication that reaches citizens directly through social media in German. The studied populist messages reflect ideational definitions of populism. Thus, populist messages appeal to the people, dismiss the elites as appalling, or highlight the peopleâ€™s right to unfettered rule. Despite German-speaking countries offering a variety of populist parties, existing automated approaches are rarely applicable to German texts. Furthermore, they are not tailored to social media and often focus only on anti-elitism. I vastly improved existing dictionaries by analyzing populist ideology in its entirety, including people-centrism and the demand for peopleâ€™s sovereignty. The article showed how known populist parties in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland spread these messages to a great extent on social media. Furthermore, I was able to highlight intra-party differences. Finally, the article discusses different aspects of validity and shows that the proposed approach offers high convergent validity and split-half reliability. }

@article{KingGary2017CKaD,
abstract = {The (unheralded) first step in many applications of automated text analysis involves selecting keywords to choose documents from a large text corpus for further study. Although all substantive results depend on this choice, researchers usually pick keywords in ad hoc ways that are far from optimal and usually biased. Most seem to think that keyword selection is easy, since they do Google searches every day, but we demonstrate that humans perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task. We offer a better approach, one that also can help with following conversations where participants rapidly innovate language to evade authorities, seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic web searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We develop a computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or human-only) statistical approach that suggests keywords from available text without needing structured data as inputs. This framing poses the statistical problem in a new way, which leads to a widely applicable algorithm. Our specific approach is based on training classifiers, extracting information from (rather than correcting) their mistakes, and summarizing results with easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We illustrate how the technique works with analyses of English texts about the Boston Marathon bombings, Chinese social media posts designed to evade censorship, and others.},

abstract = {Der Begriff „Text Mining“ bezeichnet ein Bündel von computergestützten und algorithmus-basierten Auswertungsverfahren, mit denen Informationen aus un- oder schwachstrukturierten Textdatenbeständen gewonnen werden (Puchinger 2016: 119). Die Verfahren des Text Mining gewinnen in den letzten Jahren in der empirischen Sozialforschung an Bedeutung, da immer mehr Texte – Bücher (Ernst, Kapitel 81 in diesem Band), Zeitschriften und Zeitungen (Klein, Taddicken, Kapitel 82 und 83 in diesem Band) sowie verschiedene Dokumente (Salheiser, Kapitel 80 in diesem Band), aber auch Social Media-Beiträge (Schünzel/Traue, Schmidt, Nam, Schrape/Siri, Kapitel 71, 72, 74 und 75 in diesem Band) – in digitalisierter Form vorliegen. Während die frühen Anwendungen von Text Mining meist auf die Auszählung von Wortvorkommen beschränkt waren, werden in neueren Arbeiten häufig verschiedene Werkzeuge eingesetzt, die auf die Herausarbeitung von Argumentationsstrukturen und Sinnzusammenhänge zielen; des Weiteren werden zunehmend komplexere Auswertungsstrategien entwickelt (Puchinger 2016: 129f.).},
